Project Overview:
I want to make an "game" that will train your aim, simply put, by appearing a sphere randomly in an frame thats similarly sized to a computer screen. when the user clicks on the sphere, a new sphere will appear in another random location.
When the screen is loaded, a start button will appear in the center of the screen, when the player presses play a timer begins to countdown from 60 seconds, when the time hit zero, the sphere dissapears and a start button appears. 
The amount of times a user clicks a sphere will be the "score", the score will appear on the right side of the screen. Another thing I could add is average score, or average hits per second.

Week 1:
Make spheres appear in random locations make the spheres dissapear when clicked.

Week 2:
Make a score counter appear on the screen, and timer that counts down from 60 seconds also appear on the screen.

Week 3: 
Add a start button that dissapears when clicked and begins the gameplay loop, and reappear when the game ends.
