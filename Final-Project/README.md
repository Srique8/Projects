# <ins>Project Overview:</ins>
I want to make an _game_ that will train your aim, simply put, by appearing a shape, chosen from a different variety of shapes (cubes, spheres, triangular pyramid), randomly in an frame thats similarly sized to a computer screen. when the user clicks on the shape, a new shape will appear in another random location.
When the screen is loaded, a start button will appear in the center of the screen, when the player presses play a timer begins to countdown from 60 seconds, when the time hit zero, the shapes dissapears and a start button appears. 
The amount of times a user clicks a sphere will be the "score", the score will appear on the right side of the screen. Another thing I could add is average score, or average hits per second.

## Lighting and Texture:
I want the lighting to be coming down from the top of this box and lighting the shapes as if the user is in a shooting range or in a hallway. I'm not totally sure what texture I could give the shapes exactly.
