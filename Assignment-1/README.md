#Assignment 1

I like the website "Experiments with Google" (https://experiments.withgoogle.com/search?q=WebGL) because I think the projects are entertaining and they give me ideas for things I could do as personal projects. My favorite project was the "WEBGL MAZE" (http://www.spacegoo.com/maze/) game, I think having the mouse as a control was an interesting choice and prolly isn't something I would've chosen. However it did add an extra challenge because I wasn't used to that control.
